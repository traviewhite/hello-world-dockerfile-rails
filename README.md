## Deployment Lifecycle
When first creating the app Kinsta will create a process from the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction. 
```
ENTRYPOINT ["entrypoint.sh"]
```

Note that if you change this command in the repository the process will **not** be changed by default so you will need to edit it in MyKinsta, in the processes section for your 
application.
